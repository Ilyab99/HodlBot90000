Python script(s) for displaying live ethereum data using I2C , LCD's and raspberry pi
get I2C_LCD_driver.py from https://gist.github.com/vay3t/8b0577acfdb27a78101ed16dd78ecba1
use text-requests.py , the URLLib2 version is very buggy and requires the coinmarketcap library

edit the files and put in your ethereum address, this could be done throught a config file easily, 
i guess we need a to-do list

code for both version also contains code to display nanopool statistics on the second row of the 16x2, there 
needs to be an option/version to disable it that needs to go on a todo list that doesn't exist 

my ethereum address 0x9c64Fd2804730683F3c5401aBA7285b2f33F3eDF just in case :)
